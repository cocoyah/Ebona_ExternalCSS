		<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
		<hr class="hrAbout">
		<p>Most likely, all of us have experienced having a bad day. Whenever we have problems, we can become stressed and troubled until the issue is taken care of. Whenever we are stressed, we try to look for things to vent our emotions, and sometimes the people around us might also receive the short end of the stick. For this reason, I thought of something to help relieve our stress. To start this journey, I started creating products that could possibly alleviate our feelings or emotions that cause our day to end on a bad note.</p>
